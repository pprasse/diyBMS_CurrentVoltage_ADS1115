# Holding Registers (command 3)

Returns 16 bit word value for the following configuration items.  Some items are split over two registers and will need to recombined before use.
For valid results you must read both registers as part of the same request, otherwise invalid/corrupt data will be returned.

All registers are read only, unless also specified in "Write Registers" later on

** For normal configuration, just set the shunt maximum current and millivolt registers.  Shunt_Cal is calculated as needed based on those values.  For fine tuning calibration, the SHUNT_CAL register can be written to/adjusted.  Once a register is set, it is stored in EEPROM and used when shunt is powered up.

# Bit values for Register 40017 (status flags)

Returns a BIT value (on/off) for the following configuration items:

(First byte)
|Bit|Description|Read write|
|--------|-----------|-------|
16|TMPOL|Read only
15|SHNTOL|Read only
14|SHNTUL|Read only
13|BUSOL|Read only
12|BUSUL|Read only
11|POL|Read only
10|Temperature compensation enabled|Read write
9|ADC Range 0=±163.84 mV, 1=±40.96 mV (only 40.96mV supported by diyBMS)|Read only

(Second byte)
|Bit|Description|Read write|
|--------|-----------|-------|
8|Relay Trigger on TMPOL|Read write
7|Relay Trigger on SHNTOL|Read write
6|Relay Trigger on SHNTUL|Read write
5|Relay Trigger on BUSOL|Read write
4|Relay Trigger on BUSUL|Read write
3|Relay Trigger on POL|Read write
2|Existing Relay state (0=off)|Read write
1|Factory reset bit (always 0 when read)|Read write

Bits 1 to 6 indicate the current alert state of the INA228 chip, zero means not alerted.  The RED LED will light when any of the alert states are non-zero.

Bits 9 to 14 control which alerts will trigger the relay to turn on.  Value of 1 means the alert is active/enabled.

Bit 15 returns the current relay state (and allows the relay to be manually controlled - TBC)

Bit 16 always returns zero when read (set to 1 to perform a factory reset on the monitor, returning all values to defaults - TBC)
